Being stuck at home in quarantine we bring you Code in the Dark, an application that allows anyone to learn and practice HTML/CSS. For both professionals and beginners, **Code in the Dark** is simple, and fun application that would support learning, practice, and competition in web design. We look to help support and motivate beginner into practice and give them a way to learn from more experienced individuals in the field of web development. Through Code in the Dark, we allow beginners to learn web design by having them compete and learn to code in HTML/CSS. By seeing how others build their websites, you get a first-hand view on web design techniques. Even those with no experience can join and spectate the competitions to learn the basics of HTML/CSS before they compete.  

With the spectator mode, you can view other peoples competitions and vote on their results. It is a fun, interactive way to learn from others and connect with people. You can gain experience by viewing how they are designing their website and make new friends in the spectator chat. We all need some more social interaction being isolated at home.

With all competitions going online we are passionate about bringing everyone an at home web design competition. Without the ability to see your friends in person or go out to public competitions we bring you a way to bring that joy into your home. Join up with your friends in a call and see what each of you design. Vote on your favorites and laugh together over the failures. In the end, practice your skills and have a fun competition. 

We were greatly inspired by the coding competition: Code in the Dark and wanted to make this more available to people. Especially during this pandemic, we see competitions moving to online and so we made a coding competition application that you could play with anyone. With a simple, clean interface we bring to you **Code in the Dark** where you can show off your web design skills right at your desk at home! 

## What it does

We built a VSCode extension that allows players to join games with others and compete in a blind HTML/CSS coding competition. Designed for everyone, this app allows both beginners and professional web developers to compete in a fun competition. To begin the competition, you need to create or join a room. Once there are enough people in the lobby and everyone signals they are ready, the competition starts. You are given fifteen minutes to design the website shown to you. The players are not allowed to preview their HTML/CSS code so it can create some fun and interesting outcomes. Spectators are able to join and view the competition as well and everyone votes on their favorite design in the end. 

## How we built it

During quarantine we can have fun with friends and practice coding at the same time! Without the ability to go out to competitions we now get to have a way of hunkering down at home and having fun coding with other people. With spectators and voting, this is a great way to connect with others and have fun with friends.

## What we learned
1. Wait... web sockets are just socks for the web?
2. React isnâ€™t just javascript
3. Bootstrap can help!
4. Friendship and Teamwork ;D
